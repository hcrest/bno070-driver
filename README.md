# BNO070 Sensorhub Driver

C interface code supporting the Hillcrest BNO070 Sensor Hub.

The driver implemented in this project relies on low level functions,
defined in SensorHubDev.h, for access to platform-specific i/o and
communications buses.

For an example of how to support and use this driver, see the following:
